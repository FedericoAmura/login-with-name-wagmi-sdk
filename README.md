<h1>Login with Name Wagmi Connector</h1>

<img src="./public/loginWithName.png">

A [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) connector that follows [CAIP-275][],
allowing you to add login with name into your dApp for any EMV chain.

### Warning

This is a work in progress and should not be used in production. CAIP still has not been merged into the main CAIP
repository and is still in draft.
It is likely that changes will be made.

# Usage

```typescript
// In wagmi.ts or wherever you configure wagmi
import { http, createConfig } from "wagmi";
import { mainnet } from "wagmi/chains";
import { loginWithName } from "login-with-name";
import { ENS } from "login-with-name/nameResolvers";

const chain = mainnet;
const jsonRpcUrl = "https://eth.llamarpc.com";

const nameResolver = new ENS({
  chain,
  jsonRpcUrl,
});

const requestName = async () => {
  // Here you can prompt the user for their name
  return "vitalik.eth";
};

const lwnConfig = {
  options: {
    wcConfig: {
      projectId: "WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID",
      metadata: {
        name: "Login with Name",
        description: "Log in with a domain name",
        url: window.location.origin,
        icons: ['https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37784886']
      },
    },
    nameResolver,
    getDomainName: requestName,
  },
};

const config = createConfig({
  chains: [mainnet],
  connectors: [loginWithName(lwnConfig)],
  transports: {
    [mainnet.id]: http(),
  },
});
```

Then in your dApp you can use Login with Name connector like you would use any other Wagmi connector

```tsx
import {
  useAccount,
  useBalance,
  useConnect,
  useDisconnect,
  useEnsName,
} from "wagmi";

export interface HomeProps {
}

export function Home({}: HomeProps) {
  const account = useAccount();
  const { connect, connectors } = useConnect();
  const { disconnect, connectors: connectedConnectors } = useDisconnect();
  const balance = useBalance({
    address: account.addresses?.[0],
  });
  const ensName = useEnsName({
    address: account.addresses?.[0],
  });
  const loginWithNameConnector = connectors.find((c) => c.id === "loginWithName")!;

  const disconnectConnectors = () => {
    connectedConnectors.forEach((connector) => {
      disconnect({ connector });
    });
  };

  return (
    <div className="home">

      {account.status === "connected" ? (
        <>
          <h2>Your account ðŸ”—</h2>

          <div>
            <p><span>Status:</span> {account.status}</p>
            <p><span>Addresses:</span> {JSON.stringify(account.addresses)}</p>
            <p><span>Balance:</span> {Number(balance.data?.formatted) || 0} {balance.data?.symbol}</p>
            <p><span>Chain Id:</span> {account.chainId}</p>
            {ensName.data && <p><span>ENS Name:</span> {ensName.data}</p>}
          </div>

          <button type="button" onClick={disconnectConnectors}>
            ðŸ”Œ Disconnect
          </button>
        </>
      ) : (
        <>
          <h2>Connect to your wallet</h2>

          <button onClick={() => connect({ connector: loginWithNameConnector })}>
            <img src="/loginWithName.png" alt="Login With Name" />
            Login With Name
          </button>
        </>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Installation

```bash
npm install login-with-name
```

# Demo

A working demo can be accessed at [this link](https://login-with-name-wagmi-sdk.vercel.app/)

The source of the website can be found in the `src` folder. The website provides a way to prompt the user for their names using a modal. After users have logged in, they can see their account information, sign a test message and disconnect from the wallet.
Apart from that, the website demo provides instructions to get a named wallet such as [Domain Wallet](https://domainwallet.id) or use ENS to name any wallet that you can reference within the authentication flows.

There is also a server in the `authenticator` directory, whose sole responsibility is to store and handle authentication configurations for given domain names.

# How it works?

The connector uses the CAIP-275 standard to resolve the domain name to an authentication flow. The authentication flow is then used to authenticate the user and connect the wallet.

CAIP-275 is a standard that allows you to resolve a domain name to an authentication flow. The authentication flow is a JSON object that contains the necessary information to authenticate the user and connect the wallet.

There are several steps involved in this process
1. When the user clicks on the "Login with Name" button, the connector will call the `getDomainName` function to get the domain name.
2. The connector will then use the `NameResolver` to resolve the domain name to an address and to authentication configuration. This last configuration is saved in a text record called `authenticator` for that same domain name.
3. If the authentication configuration is an URL, the connector will resolve the URL and get the actual authentication configuration.
4. The connector will then use the authentication flow configuration to authenticate the user and connect the wallet as described in the [CAIP-275][] standard.
