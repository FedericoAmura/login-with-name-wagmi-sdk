        <p>
          This step can be done two ways.<br />
          We can take the simple option, which is getting a wallet that is already named and integrated.<br />
          Or we can configure all the necessary components and use your own wallet.<br />
          You will have to do this only once.

            <h3>Easy route</h3>

            <p>Getting a wallet that is already named and integrated. This is the ideal option for dApp users.
            <br />You can get a <a href="https://domainwallet.id" target="_blank">Domain Wallet</a>, they are already named and integrated into this demo</p>
            <Link to={'/domainWallet'}>

          <div className="registration-option">
            <h3>Advanced route</h3>

            <p>Setting up the config for your own wallets. This is the path that wallet and dApp developers have to follow.
            <br />We will guide you setting up the authentication flows config and name resolver</p>

      <div className="step-done">
        <p>
          That's all! After registering you will be able to log in any <span>Login with Name</span> integrated dApp.<br />
          Not just this one, as long as other dApps integrate the same name resolvers you can use your name to log in.
        </p>
        <p>No more remembering complex addresses, or where you have their keys. Just your name âœ¨</p>
